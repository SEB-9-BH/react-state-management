**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to tktk

CREATOR GUIDANCE:

This one's got the good stuff of the lesson, where you respond to a user event by using the setState handler function. Make sure the event is still an onClick of a button for now.

This is also where you could demo the immutability of state by giving a nice warning section in the vein of "THIS WONT WORK AND HERES WHY" after a code snippet with `valueInState = newValue`.

Buildable demo: complete the dark mode light mode toggle, you could challenge students to create a third button with a third lighting mode.

Hold off on using inputs, as we haven't gotten to the controlled forms in react lesson yet and we don't want students using vanilla JS to access DOM elements. It requires a bit of creativity to keep using button-based apps instead of ones with legitimate inputs, but the avoidance of document.getElementById type business is the goal of doing so.

For a you-do challenge you could also leverage an app with a counter and buttons that increment or decrement (sometimes by 1, sometimes by 5 maybe?). 

A final potential suggestion application would be selecting between "characters" by clicking an image and having things on the page change both style and content based on which character you've chosen.

Use your imagination in coming up with all the button-based toggling apps your can think of!
