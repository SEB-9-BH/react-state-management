# ![React State Management - Updating Complex State](./assets/hero.png)

**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to update arrays in the state while maintaining immutability, using the `useState` hook

## Working with arrays in state

In our previous lesson, we focused on updating a simple boolean value in the state with React's `useState`. While toggling a boolean is straightforward and common, many real-world scenarios in React involve more complex state structures, like objects and arrays. As applications grow in complexity, youâ€™ll often find yourself managing these more robust data types. Therefore, it's important to understand how correctly update objects and arrays in state.

Let's look at a more detailed example to illustrate this:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [cats, setCats] = useState([
    { name: 'Myshka', breed: 'Ragdoll' },
    { name: 'Malta', breed: 'Turkish Angora' }
  ]);

  const addCat = (newCat) => {
    // spread current cats array and newCat object into a new array
    const newCatsArray = [...cats, newCat]
    // call state setter function with this new array
    setCats(newCatsArray)
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => addCat({ name: 'Kira', breed: 'Ragamuffin' })}>
        Add Cat
      </button>
      <ul>
        {cats.map((cat, idx) => <li key={idx}> {cat.name} </li>)}
      </ul>
    <>
  );
};
```

1. In this `ExampleComponent`, we're working with a state variable named `cats`, which is initialized as an array containing objects. Each object represents a cat, with properties like its name and breed. This setup is a common pattern in React applications, where you manage a list of items as an array in your state.

2. To simplify our example and focus on the state management aspect, we're directly passing a new cat object to the `addCat` function when the button is clicked. In a real-world application, this data might typically come from a form input where users can add details of a new cat. However, for our learning purposes, we use hardcoded data to demonstrate how the state updates with new items.


Here's how it works: Upon clicking the button, addCat is called with a predefined cat object. Inside addCat, we use the spread operator `...` to create a new array that contains all existing cats plus the new one. This method ensures we're *not modifying the original state directly* but creating a new updated version of it, which is a key practice in React for ensuring smooth and predictable state updates.

```js
  const addCat = (newCat) => {
    // spread current cats array and newCat object into a new array
    const newCatsArray = [...cats, newCat]
    // call state setter function with this new array
    setCats(newCatsArray)
  };
```

After `setCats` is invoked, React is going to determine if it should re-render based on a comparison between the old value `state`, and the new value `nextState`, as provided to our state setter function. 

If we didn't make a new array to pass to `setCats`, and instead just pushed the object into state directly, both the old value and the new value would just be pointing to the same array in memory. As a result, React would skip re-rendering, and the list of cats wouldn't change for the user. As you can imagine, this mismatch between the state of the app and the information rendered to the user is a big problem! 

This is why we need to maintain immutability - instead of mutating the array, we need to make a copy of the original array, make changes to that copy, and then replace the original with it! 

```jsx
  const addCat = (newCat) => {
    setCats([...cats, newCat])
  };
```
